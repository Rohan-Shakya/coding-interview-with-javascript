# Queue Using Stack

Implement the class Queue using stacks. The queue methods you need to implement are enqueue, dequeue, peek, and empty.

## Methods:

- Enqueue: Append a value to the end of the queue.

- Dequeue: Remove and the value at the start of the queue.

- Peek: Return the value at the start of the queue.

- Empty: Return a boolean value of whether the queue is empty or not.

## Q/A

- Do the queue methods we have to implement need to perform at the same complexity of a real queue?
  - No, but they should be as performant as possible.
