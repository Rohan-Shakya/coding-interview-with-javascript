> Data Structure are collections of values, the relationships among them, and the functions or operations that can be applied to the data

It contains few popular questions and answers with their optimal solutions that may ask during the Software Engineering Interview.

## Steps that you have to follow when solving problems:

Before we begin how to solve the questions, we have follow few steps. They are:

- Step 1: Verify the constraints
- Step 2: Write ot some test cases
- Step 3: Figure out a solution without code
- Step 4: Write out our solution in code
- Step 5: Double check for errors
- Step 6: Test our code with our test cases
- Step 7: Optimizing our code
- Step 8: Testing our optimal solution
- Step 9: Checking performance
