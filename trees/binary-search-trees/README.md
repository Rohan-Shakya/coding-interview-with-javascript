# Binary Search Trees

A binary search tree (BST) is a binary tree where each node has a Comparable key (and an associated value) and satisfies the restriction that the key in any node is larger than the keys in all nodes in that node's left subtree and smaller than the keys in all nodes in that node's right subtree.

# How BSTS Work

- Every parent node has at most **two** children.
- Every node to the left of a parent node is **always less**
  than the parent
- Every node to the right of a parent node is
  **always greater** than the parent
