# Tree Traversal

Tree traversal (also known as tree search and walking the tree) is a form of graph traversal and refers to the process of visiting (e.g. retrieving, updating, or deleting) each node in a tree data structure, exactly once.

## Two ways

- Breadth-First-Search (BFS)
- Depth-First-Search (DFS)
  - DFS - InOrder
  - DFS - PreOrder
  - DFS - PostOrder
