# Stack

> A LIFO data structure!

The last element added to the stack will be the first element
removed from the stack.
Stacks are used to handle function invocations(the call stack),
for operations like undo/redo, and routing and much more!

## Uses

- Managing function invocations
- Undo / Redo
- Routing (the history object) is treated like a stack!
